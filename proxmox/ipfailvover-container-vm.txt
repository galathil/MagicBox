To link an IP to container/VM :

1) Buy an IP failover on SoYouStart dashboard, then create a "virtual OVH mac address"
2) On your Proxmox, create a VM/Container.
3) On the network section, you must have an interface like this :
- Mac : OVH virtual mac
- Bridge : Select the vmbrX (from the host)
- IPV4 : Static
- IPV4/CIDR : xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/24 (with your failover-ip)
- Gateway (IPV4) : yyyy.yyyy.yyyy.254 (y is your host IP, must be ending with 254)
- IPV6 : I don't know, never configure this)
